# Scenario

Zain lives in an old house for almost 1 year. His financial situation improved over that period and he decided to migrate to a better house. His friend Saad advised him to head over to a new website called BAYTI since it provides an easy way to search for rented houses globally. However, the current website allows users to search for houses and filter the result by price only. He opened an issue to the customer services advising them to add more filters including the rental duration,  contract type, location, rating, and house quality.

# Task

Choose one of the given problems.

# Problem 1

Suppose your manager assigned a task for you. You're required to develop a filter-based solution for clients in order to find their dream house quickly and easily. 

> Notes

1. Testing is a must!
2. It's not required to work on implementing front-end UI since your colleges will handle that.
3. Provide clear documentation for your way of thinking and code.
4. Keep in mind that new filters might be added very frequently to the website. So proof that your filters implementation is actually scalable and flexible.
5. Preferred to use Laravel framework as back-end side.

# Problem 2

Implement a scalable payment gateway which supports quick substitution to any payment service in the future.
